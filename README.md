## 🗺️ Features
- **3D Mapping**: Uses SLAM-ORB for real-time map generation
- **Indoor Positioning**: Multiset SDK integration for precise localization
- **Augmented Navigation**: Visual markers and AR-based path guidance
- **Unity Engine**: Seamless visualization and user-friendly UI
- **Real-time Updates**: Dynamic path recalculations based on movement

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Unity** (for rendering and interaction)
- **SLAM-ORB** (for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
- **Multiset SDK** (for positioning and sensor fusion)
- **C#** (for scripting and logic implementation)


## 🎯 Usage
1. **Scan the environment** to generate a 3D map
2. **Mark destination** within the mapped area
3. **Follow navigation cues** (AR overlays, directional pointers)

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- AI-based route optimization
- Voice-guided navigation
- Cloud-based map sharing
